# Airbnb-Data

Looking at listing data provided by Inside Airbnb for the Washington D.C. Metro Area. Inside Airbnb provides data on Airbnb listings in many large cities and significant 
locations around the world. They also do some analysis of this data to provide users with an idea of how Airbnb and its hosts operate. We expound on that analysis here. I 
chose Washington D.C. as it is a popular tourist destination with much to see in a relatively small area, and I would like to know as much as possible about the rentals in 
the area before going!

I reconstructed the listings map from Inside Airbnb along with some other visuals here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092/viz/AirbnbinWashingtonDC/Dashboard1
